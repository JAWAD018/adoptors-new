    <p> In the course of transit from primitive to modern age, the concept of adoption has undergone a radical change. Adoption, being mostly like other social institutions is essentially a product of historical and evolutionary process. Reforms related to the old Hindu law were seen and one of them was in guise of a codified law on adoptions, called as Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. Section 2 of HAMA allows any person who comes within the definition of ‘Hindu’ to be eligible to take a child for adoption. Various progressive changes were brought by this new codified law like adoption by female Hindu, girl child being eligible for adoption etc.[1]

    Concept of Adoption
    The reason why the concept of adoption was brought was giving the right to family for the orphan, abandoned and surrendered children. The objective behind bringing this concept was to secure performance of one’s funeral rights and to preserve the continuation of one’s lineage. In order to restore the family life to a child deprived of his or her biological family, the concept of adoption was considered the best means.
    
    There are many international conventions on Human Rights that expressly mention the positive duty in order to provide protection and assistance to children like Convention on Rights of Child, 1989 (CRC) which is a reservoir of various rights which are concerned with children. The concept of adoption is not applicable to other communities like Muslims, Parsis and Christians. For that, they recourse to Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Such a process makes him or her their child not an adopted child. Under this, a child who turns 21 years remains no longer a ward and assume individual identities. When comes to the orphan, abandoned and surrendered children, these aforesaid enactments remain silent. For the adoption of these categories, there was as such no codifies legislation.[2]
    
    In order to consider all these categories, laudable attempt was made by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. The reason why such attempt is commendable is that such an enactment allowed secular adoption of the child irrespective of his or her religious community. This enactment has given the right to all citizens to adopt and all children to be adopted. As per Supreme Court’s directions, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) which is the current apex controlling body in relating to the matters of legal adoption which was based on the judgment inLakshmi Kant Pandey v.Union of India[3],where under section 41(3) of the JJ Act, CARA has framed a set of guidelines.
    
    Capacity of The Indian Male And Female Relating To Adoption
    As already discussed, there are two legislations that deal with the adoption of a child. These legislations are:
    1.The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 and
    2.The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000
    
    Capacity of the Hindu male and females to adopt a child is discusses under section 7 and 8 of the HAMA respectively.

    4.At the time if adoption, if a person has more than one wife, it is necessary to take the consent of all wives.
    In the case of Bhooloram & Ors.v. Ramlal & Ors[7],a question was raise before the court whether it is necessary to take the consent of all wives, if a person has more than one wife living at the time of adoption?
    It was held by the court that if a wife has absconded to any unknown place, she cannot be construed as dead unless the ingredients of section 7 of the Act are complied with.
